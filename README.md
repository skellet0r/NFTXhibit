# Python Dev Dapp Template

A template for building dapps with `eth-brownie` and `reactjs`.

## Getting Started

There are a couple of things you'll need to edit once you've created your repository using this template:

- [ ] Change project name in `package.json`
- [ ] Update README.md

To initialize your environment you'll need to have the following dependencies pre-installed:

- [ ] `pip` - package manager
- [ ] `npm` - package manager

> Note: This project uses python for smart contract development, but reactjs and nodejs for front-end development.

Follow the steps below to complete the environment initialization:

```bash
$ python -m venv venv
$ ./venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ npm install
```
